# camera-viewer-app

*Please note that this is a personal project. Its aim is not to be publicly used, but still, I will offer minimum support 
if you encounter a bug (might as well accept feature request only if I'm not lazy too)*

## Why ?

I wanted to play games on my Switch and also screen share it on Discord to my friends. So I bought a HDMI to USB adapter
which would "emulate" a camera with microphone from the HDMI input stream (because capture cards are freaking expensive).

I found multiple software allowing to stream the video/audio stream, but none of them had video and audio synchronized
or had decent latency to not obliterate the game experience.

So what was my last option ? DIY !

## Support

This software can support any video/audio stream as long as they are detected as input device by the OS. 
Although I don't know how this would be useful streaming your camera with your microphone, but that works too.

## Bug, Feature request

As stated above, I won't offer full support and active development on this project. As long as it works for me, I won't 
update it.

If you ever encounter a bug, open an issue, I might look into it when I don't have better things to do. 

If you have a feature request, do not hesitate to also open an issue, but keep in mind that I can straight up refuse 
working on it due to my laziness (or wait for an undefined amount of time).


## How to use

Not really the most complicated software out there:

- Right click to hide/show the UI
- F11 to enable fullscreen
- Scroll on the volume bar to change volume


## TODO

- [x] Change volume within the app
- [ ] Toggle fullscreen with double click
- [ ] Video settings (resolution & framerate)
- [ ] Add back the close button (you can use CTRL+W or ALT+F4 in the meantime)
- [ ] Auto device list refresh (restart or CTRL+R in the meantime)
- [ ] Keep the volume level when switching audio source
