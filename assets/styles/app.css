/**
    Main CSS file.

    -| Why all of this ?

    It has been split in multiple file to keep it more organized as CSS files tends to be big VERY fast, and using SCSS
    just for file separation seems a bit overkill.

    As CSS file support both variable & includes, let's just use it.

    -| Isn't that slower ?

    If it was a regular webpage, yes it would be. In an Electron App context however, every files are loaded locally,
    thus reducing delay and network download time, which make loading multiple file just a tiny little bit slower,
    but nowhere enough to impact negatively the user experience.
